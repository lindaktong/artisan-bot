       "'What Is Email Warmup? | Artisan AI Help Center\\n\\nEmail warmup works by gradually increasing the volume of emails sent from a new account over a period of time. This establishes a positive reputation with Internet Service Providers (ISPs), which improves deliverability and reduces the chance of emails getting flagged as spam. Given our recommendation to register new email accounts on our platform, we provide a built-in email warmup service. This ensures your mailboxes are prepared to handle your outbound email campaigns effectively. Warmup is an ongoing process that happens when you do cold outreach to protect your mailbox health. Our warmup service will send emails from your new account to dummy addresses. We\\'ll start with a low volume of emails and then gradually increase the number of emails sent every day. Again, email warmup is an extremely common practice in cold outreach and necessary to avoid your messages getting flagged as spam. We use the keyword “Artz” in all of our warmup emails so that you know these are definitely warm up emails! Warmup emails tend to have random subjects, so will look out of place in your sent folder. Here’s an example of a warmup email: Email warmup is an ongoing process designed to gradually increase your sending limit while maintaining the health of your email account. Initially, this process \"warms up\" your account, starting with a limit of 10 emails per day, and progressively expands to a maximum of 75 emails per mailbox. As you continue to send cold emails, this ongoing warmup supports the balance and health of your email activities. You can monitor the progression of your email capacity on our dashboard. Once your email is fully warmed up, Ava will continue sending warm-up emails from your account to maintain your mailbox health. Yep! During her warmup period, Ava sends fake interactions to dummy accounts. There’s no need to be concerned about these odd emails showing up in your inbox. They’re not going to any actual prospects. You haven’t been hacked! A red email status indicates your mailbox health is low. This may occur early in the email warmup process, but should not persist after three weeks. If you still have a red status after three weeks, there’s usually a problem with your DMS settings. Make sure your DKIM, DMARC, and SPF records are configured correctly for email deliverability. You can find an article on how to adjust your email settings here:https://support.artisan.co/en/articles/8774818-how-to-set-up-your-dkim-spf-and-dmarc'"

       "\"Ava Isn’t Sending Out My Emails. Why? | Artisan AI Help Center\\n\\nWe’re sorry to hear Ava has not been sending out your emails. There are several ways to troubleshoot the problem. By going over the steps below, we’re confident you’ll get Ava back up and running! Are you within the first three weeks of your account? If so, you may still be in the warmup period. Our built-in email warmup service helps establish your domain reputation to ensure Ava's emails do not get filtered to spam. During this time, Ava gradually builds up the number of emails she sends per day. It takes approximately three weeks for your mailbox to reach full sending capacity. To learn more about Email Warmup, check out our article here:https://support.artisan.co/en/articles/9191300-what-is-email-warmup In your Mailboxes page, make sure you have enough emails connected and that they all have a green status. You can find out how many emails you need per plan here:https://support.artisan.co/en/articles/9191325-how-many-email-addresses-do-i-need-for-different-plans Check that your DKIM, DMARC, and SPF records are configured correctly. These settings are crucial for email deliverability and ensuring that your emails do not end up in the spam folder or get rejected by the recipient's email server. You can find an article on how to set up your DNS settings here here:https://support.artisan.co/en/articles/8774818-how-to-set-up-your-dkim-spf-and-dmarc We always recommend manually approving emails when you first start using Ava. With Autopilot disabled, Ava will populate emails on the Emails Pending Approval page for you to review before sending. You’ll need to come on the platform each day to approve emails and review any responses. If Ava is not sending emails, check to see if you still have pending emails to approve. Ava can find leads for you based on the targeted customer persona you select. You can also upload your own CSV file of leads for Ava to reach out to. If you do not have a target customer persona set up, Ava will be unable to find leads and conduct outreach. If Ava has reached out to everyone on your CSV list, she will also stop sending emails. At this point, you need to either upload a new CSV or set up a new target customer persona. If you’ve tried all of the above and your emails still aren’t sending, please get in touch with us via Intercom. Someone from our team will get back to you as soon as possible to work out the issue!\""

       "\"Getting Started with Artisan Sales | Artisan AI Help Center\\n\\nWelcome to our platform! We’re excited to have you here. The Artisan Sales platform is designed to streamline your outbound workflow, with all the tools you need in one place. We have built-in email warmup, bounce testing, and mailbox health monitoring to ensure your deliverability is optimized. We also have an analytics dashboard, so you can check which campaigns and playbooks are doing the best. And of course, we have our AI BDR Ava, who automates all the manual parts of outbound for you! Once you've set up your campaign, she helps you find leads, does research on them, and writes personalized emails for you to review and send. To make things easy for you, we’ve made sure our platform set-up is straightforward and user-friendly. Below, you’ll find a complete guide to getting started so you can dive straight into supercharging your outreach! Once you’ve signed up for a trial, log in to the platform to get started! You’ll first be greeted by Ava in our chat interface. She’ll guide you through how to set up your first campaign. During your chat, Ava will ask you for some information on the kind of leads you want to target, and the offering you’d like to pitch. You might want to have this information handy, so you can breeze through the onboarding! Ava will ask you for: Your Target Customer Persona What countries do you want to target? What about industries? Job titles? Company size? About Your Company Provide a one sentence summary of what your company provides. (We recommend being as specific as possible here!) What features does your product/service offer? What pain points does your product/service address? Proof points: What sets you apart from the competition, such as awards, high rankings on review sites, or notable performance metrics? A few other things she’ll need from you: Your calendar link for booking meetings Your preferred tone of voice for emails The sender name to sign-off emails (Ava sends out emails on behalf of you and your team, so no one knows they’re AI-generated!) Make sure you spend as much time as you need on this part of the process. The more Ava knows, the better quality her emails will be. Once Ava has the information she needs to get started, she’ll ask you to set up your mailboxes that she’ll be sending emails from. We recommend setting up a secondary domain to safeguard your main domain’s reputation. When you’re sending out lots of emails, it’s a lot easier to be flagged by spam filters. If they flag you, it can affect your ability to reach prospects' inboxes. Using a secondary domain lets you experiment with A/B testing and optimize your email strategies, without putting your main communication lines at risk. We’ve created a guide that guides you through the entire process of creating a secondary domain. Check it outhere. Once you’ve set up your secondary domain, there’s just one final step before Ava is ready to start sending out emails! Since you’ve created new email addresses, it’s crucial that you set up your DNS settings. This ensures that your emails reliably reach their destination and helps prevent them from being marked as spam. These settings include DKIM, SPF, and DMARC, which all work together to optimize your mailbox health. You can check outthis articlefor further help. After your campaign is all set up and your mailbox health is at 100%, Ava begins populating your outbound CRM in the “Leads” tab. She does this by scraping her database of 300M+ B2B contacts and identifying your prospects based on the target customer persona information you provided during the onboarding process. You can click into each lead on the page to learn more about them. You can also delete them from your workflow here, if they're not a good match! Once Ava has identified leads based on your TCP, she will scrape leads’ websites to learn information necessary to crafting hyper-personalized messages. You can view these in the “Pending Approval” tab! To ensure your messages land in the intended recipient’s inbox and not the spam filter, Ava undergoes a 3-week email warmup period. She starts by sending 5 to 10 emails a day to dummy accounts to build up domain reputation. For more information, seeour guide to email warmup. After 3 weeks, Ava starts sending out emails at full capacity. This means she’ll send 75 emails per mailbox per day. When you’re first getting started, we highly recommend enabling copilot mode. With copilot activated, Ava will populate emails on the Emails Pending Approval page for you to review before sending. Each day, you’ll mark emails approved on Ava’s dashboard and review any responses. One of Ava’s most exciting features is that she is able to learn over time based on the responses she receives. As she sends out more and more emails, she’ll self-optimize to improve positive response rates. Don't let anyone miss out—invite your teammates to join the platform and see what it's like to have an AI co-worker by your side! Head over to “Account Settings” and bring them into the fold. You can add them as Delegates to share your existing account, or as Members for them to have their own seat on the platform. Integrate with Slack  to talk to Ava directly through your work channel. We also integrate with Salesforce and HubSpot, so you can export your engaged leads and ensure you don’t reach out to anyone who’s already in your CRM. Once you're all set up on our platform, all you need to do is check back for responses on the Inbox page. Ava will also send you a daily summary of all the responses you've received, via email. If you don't have autopilot turned on, you'll also need to check back every day to approve emails on your Pending Approval page. If you have any questions along the way, please visitour help center. If you run into any issues you can’t fix, please reach out to us via Intercom. Someone will be in touch to help!\""

      "\n",
      "Watch the video tutorial on Youtube here:https://youtu.be/Q2cvz48wdKg?feature=shared If you would like Ava to contact a list of leads you’ve generated yourself, you can upload a CSV file with the leads included. Doing so is a simple process. All you need to do is click on \"Upload CSV\" button in the Target Customer Persona section of your Campaign Settings: Once you upload your file, Ava should be ready to start drafting emails! However, there are a few things you should be aware of when working off your own CSV file. For Ava to use your CSV file, she'll need the following information about your leads: Email Address First Name Organization Name Job Title Website The reason why Ava needs this information is because this is all essential information for her to draft her hyper-personalized emails. Before uploading your CSV, make sure you’ve included all of this information. If you don't know the job title of particular leads, you can put 'Other' in the cell. After selecting the CSV file to upload, map each column to the corresponding label using the dropdown menu. This step ensures that Ava reads your CSV correctly! If you opt to upload a CSV, Ava willonlyemail leads off of this list. She will not use her search settings to find leads for your campaign. Each day, Ava will pull the amount of leads from your CSV that is proportionate to the plan you have. When Ava runs out of leads, she’ll pause her outreach. To continue, you’ll need to either upload a new CSV or set up a campaign with your target customer persona so Ava can find leads for you.\n",

      "\n",
      "Welcome to our platform! We’re excited to have you here. The Artisan Sales platform is designed to streamline your outbound workflow, with all the tools you need in one place. We have built-in email warmup, bounce testing, and mailbox health monitoring to ensure your deliverability is optimized. We also have an analytics dashboard, so you can check which campaigns and playbooks are doing the best. And of course, we have our AI BDR Ava, who automates all the manual parts of outbound for you! Once you've set up your campaign, she helps you find leads, does research on them, and writes personalized emails for you to review and send. To make things easy for you, we’ve made sure our platform set-up is straightforward and user-friendly. Below, you’ll find a complete guide to getting started so you can dive straight into supercharging your outreach! Once you’ve signed up for a trial, log in to the platform to get started! You’ll first be greeted by Ava in our chat interface. She’ll guide you through how to set up your first campaign. During your chat, Ava will ask you for some information on the kind of leads you want to target, and the offering you’d like to pitch. You might want to have this information handy, so you can breeze through the onboarding! Ava will ask you for: Your Target Customer Persona What countries do you want to target? What about industries? Job titles? Company size? About Your Company Provide a one sentence summary of what your company provides. (We recommend being as specific as possible here!) What features does your product/service offer? What pain points does your product/service address? Proof points: What sets you apart from the competition, such as awards, high rankings on review sites, or notable performance metrics? A few other things she’ll need from you: Your calendar link for booking meetings Your preferred tone of voice for emails The sender name to sign-off emails (Ava sends out emails on behalf of you and your team, so no one knows they’re AI-generated!) Make sure you spend as much time as you need on this part of the process. The more Ava knows, the better quality her emails will be. Once Ava has the information she needs to get started, she’ll ask you to set up your mailboxes that she’ll be sending emails from. We recommend setting up a secondary domain to safeguard your main domain’s reputation. When you’re sending out lots of emails, it’s a lot easier to be flagged by spam filters. If they flag you, it can affect your ability to reach prospects' inboxes. Using a secondary domain lets you experiment with A/B testing and optimize your email strategies, without putting your main communication lines at risk. We’ve created a guide that guides you through the entire process of creating a secondary domain. Check it outhere. Once you’ve set up your secondary domain, there’s just one final step before Ava is ready to start sending out emails! Since you’ve created new email addresses, it’s crucial that you set up your DNS settings. This ensures that your emails reliably reach their destination and helps prevent them from being marked as spam. These settings include DKIM, SPF, and DMARC, which all work together to optimize your mailbox health. You can check outthis articlefor further help. After your campaign is all set up and your mailbox health is at 100%, Ava begins populating your outbound CRM in the “Leads” tab. She does this by scraping her database of 300M+ B2B contacts and identifying your prospects based on the target customer persona information you provided during the onboarding process. You can click into each lead on the page to learn more about them. You can also delete them from your workflow here, if they're not a good match! Once Ava has identified leads based on your TCP, she will scrape leads’ websites to learn information necessary to crafting hyper-personalized messages. You can view these in the “Pending Approval” tab! To ensure your messages land in the intended recipient’s inbox and not the spam filter, Ava undergoes a 3-week email warmup period. She starts by sending 5 to 10 emails a day to dummy accounts to build up domain reputation. For more information, seeour guide to email warmup. After 3 weeks, Ava starts sending out emails at full capacity. This means she’ll send 75 emails per mailbox per day. When you’re first getting started, we highly recommend enabling copilot mode.

      "We’re sorry to hear Ava has not been sending out your emails. There are several ways to troubleshoot the problem. By going over the steps below, we’re confident you’ll get Ava back up and running! Are you within the first three weeks of your account? If so, you may still be in the warmup period. Our built-in email warmup service helps establish your domain reputation to ensure Ava's emails do not get filtered to spam. During this time, Ava gradually builds up the number of emails she sends per day. It takes approximately three weeks for your mailbox to reach full sending capacity. To learn more about Email Warmup, check out our article here:https://support.artisan.co/en/articles/9191300-what-is-email-warmup In your Mailboxes page, make sure you have enough emails connected and that they all have a green status.

You can find an article on how to set up your DNS settings here here:https://support.artisan.co/en/articles/8774818-how-to-set-up-your-dkim-spf-and-dmarc We always recommend manually approving emails when you first start using Ava. With Autopilot disabled, Ava will populate emails on the Emails Pending Approval page for you to review before sending. You’ll need to come on the platform each day to approve emails and review any responses. If Ava is not sending emails, check to see if you still have pending emails to approve. Ava can find leads for you based on the targeted customer persona you select. You can also upload your own CSV file of leads for Ava to reach out to. If you do not have a target customer persona set up, Ava will be unable to find leads and conduct outreach. If Ava has reached out to everyone on your CSV list, she will also stop sending emails. At this point, you need to either upload a new CSV or set up a new target customer persona. If you’ve tried all of the above and your emails still aren’t sending, please get in touch with us via Intercom.

      "How To Create A New Campaign | Artisan AI Help Center\n",
      "\n",
      "Watch the video tutorial on Youtube here:https://youtu.be/90OPFY5v6A8?si=hwc55rtrD47G3YRr Ready to create a brand new outbound campaign with Ava? Great! There are two ways you can get started, which we’ll go over here. This method is very similar to how you first set up your campaign with Ava. Go to the “Chat with Ava” page on the platform and ask her to help you create a new campaign. Just like you did when you initially onboarded Ava, you’ll go over information such as your target customer persona, campaign pitch, calendar link, and so on. Ava will guide you through this process step-by-step. Once you’re done, your new campaign will appear on the 'Campaigns' page of the platform for you to review. You can also create a campaign manually, allowing you to input information directly into text boxes. To get started, head to your \"Campaigns\" page and hit “Create Campaign” in the top left corner. First, set a name for your campaign. From here, you’ll filter your targets by areas such as region, job title, sector, and so on. You can further limit your target persona with keywords. For example, you could opt to target people who work in the AI sector exclusively by adding \"AI\" as a keyword. You can also blacklist competitors and current users to ensure you don’t accidentally send them any messages. Once you’re done, make sure you hit “Save Changes” before heading to the next section! After you’ve defined your customer persona, move on to the “Campaign Pitch” tab of your campaign settings. Here, you’ll give Ava all the information she needs to draft a compelling email to your leads. Enter your company website and a short, succinct sales pitch. Ava will use this to describe your company to leads. For example, if we were creating a campaign pitch for Artisan AI, we might write something like, “We’ve created the world's first AI BDR, Ava, who can automatically find your leads, do lead research, and draft hyper-personalized emails on behalf of your team.” From there, you’ll be asked to fill in your features, pain points, and proof points. We recommend you includeat least three or fourof these to ensure Ava can fully explain your company’s offering to potential customers. This should include any unique features that will help sell your product or service. For our Artisan pitch, for example, we might say, “Ava drafts you hundreds of personalized emails based on advanced web scraping to ensure that each cold email is compelling to your target customer persona.” Pain points give you the chance to concretely advertise your product or service’s benefits. Make sure to be specific here and stateexactlywhat problem you’re going to help leads solve. Going back to our Artisan AI pitch, we might say, “Manual email personalization is time-consuming. Most sales reps spend hundreds of hours individually researching leads and drafting personalized emails.” Proof points are what help you stand out to buyers. Has your company received any awards? Been featured in any major media publication? Do you have any impressive performance metrics to share? Include that here. For example, a proof point for Artisan AI might be, “We're backed by the prestigious startup school Y Combinator.” Once you’ve entered your features, pain points, and proof points, be sure to save your changes. Now, Ava has all the information she needs to draft cold emails for your team. Once you’re done entering your campaign information, you’ll move on to the final section, which is “Campaign Outreach”. Here, you’ll make a few final decisions about the style of your emails before activating your campaign. Select the language you want Ava to use to communicate with leads. Right now, Ava writes in 40+ different languages. You can choose to add a custom email signature to the bottom of all your emails. This can be modified on the \"Account Settings\" page of the platform. You can include any information you want, including your full name, job title, company name, company website, and phone number. Upload a link to your calendar so leads can book meetings with you. If you don't want to include a calendar link for the moment, you can enter \"google.com\" as a placeholder. Ava will know to not share this with your leads! Select the tone of voice you want Ava to use during outreach. Popular ones include \"friendly\" and \"professional\"! Playbooks are different styles of AI-generated email outreach. Right now, you can choose from the following: Classic Sales Pitch: The standard sales pitch of compliment, relate, and sell. Uno Reverse: Asks leads engaging business questions to start the conversation. Ultrahuman: Deliberately writes in a casual, friendly manner, occasionally including typos and errors to give the impression that a human wrote the email. If you don't want Ava to draft emails for you, you also have the option to use email templates to write your own emails to leads. For more information on how to use email templates, check out our 'How-To' video here:https://youtu.be/7hAMTNOKyYY?si=rXFY829SXriO31YR You’re all set! Now, all you have to do is set your campaign to active and Ava will start populating leads and drafting emails.\n",
